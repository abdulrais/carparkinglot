// I used java language to make application. Before running program you should have jdk in your system and set classpath to execute program.

1. First compile all java files in terminal using, "javac carparkinglot/*.java". // carparkinglot is package name.
2. After succssfully compiled run main java file using, "java carparkinglot/CarParkingLot" // CarParkingLot is main java file.
3. After running the main file. Please input parameter as "input file path" and "output file path".
4. After successfully created output file. Enter interactive command in terminal to run further program.
5. To terminate the program just press the enter key.

Important:
1. I assumed we are entering first interactive command for creating parking lot as Example: "create_parking_lot 6".
2. I used test cases as given in assignment pdf file(for both file read and interactive commands).
